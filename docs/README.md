# microBPF Documentation Index

This index links the core project documents and suggests a reading order based on
how most people onboard: overview first, then architecture and tooling, then deep
reference material.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. [microBPF](../README.md) - Project overview, build/test steps, and quickstart.
2. [microBPF Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Runtime components and data flow.
3. [microBPF Toolchain Guide](TOOLCHAIN.md) - Compile, manifest, assemble, and sign.
4. [microBPF Package Format (.mbpf)](PACKAGE_FORMAT.md) - Binary format details for tooling.
5. [microBPF C API Reference](C_API_REFERENCE.md) - Embedder-facing APIs and structures.
6. [microBPF JavaScript API Reference](JS_API_REFERENCE.md) - Program author APIs and helpers.
7. [microBPF Technical Specification (Draft)](../SPEC.md) - Full spec and rationale.
